Introduction to Binary Tree

Binary Tree:  Inside a guy, it can have at most 2 guys or node can have at most 2 nodes.
Leaf Node: The nodes which do not have any children.
Root Node: The top node where the path starts.
Ancestors: From the current node's parent to till the root node are the ancestors of the current node.
SubTree: All the nodes below the current node forms the sub tree.

There are 5 types of Binary Trees: 
    - Full Binary Tree
    - Complete Binary Tree
    - Perfect Binary Tree
    - Balanced Binary Tree
    - Degenerate Tree

Full Binary Tree      : A node can have either 0 or 2 children.
Completed Binary Tree : All the levels of the tree should be completely filled, except last level and the last level has all 
                        nodes on the left to be filled completely.
Perfect Binary Tree   : All the leaf nodes should be present at the same level.
Balanced Binary Tree  : The height of the Binary Tree at max should be log(n), where n is the number of nodes.
Degenerate Tree       : Every node can have atmost 1 child. Ex: skew tree etc.

There are two types of Traversals, they are BFS and DFS.

There are three types of DFS (Depth First Traversal) Traversals:
    - PreOrder Traversal: (Root + Left + Right)
    - InOrder Traversal: (Left + Root + Right)
    - PostOrder Traversal: (Left + Right + Root)

In BFS (Breadth First Traversal) Traversal, we use Level Order Traversal. Which goes level by level.
